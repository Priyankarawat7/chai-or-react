     React Fiber Architecture
Introduction
React Fiber is an ongoing reimplementation of React's core algorithm. It is the culmination of over two years of research by the React team.

The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures. Its headline feature is incremental rendering: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.

Other key features include the ability to pause, abort, or reuse work as new updates come in; the ability to assign priority to different types of updates; and new concurrency primitives.

About this document
Fiber introduces several novel concepts that are difficult to grok solely by looking at code. This document began as a collection of notes I took as I followed along with Fiber's implementation in the React project. As it grew, I realized it may be a helpful resource for others, too.

I'll attempt to use the plainest language possible, and to avoid jargon by explicitly defining key terms. I'll also link heavily to external resources when possible.

Please note that I am not on the React team, and do not speak from any authority. This is not an official document. I have asked members of the React team to review it for accuracy.

This is also a work in progress. Fiber is an ongoing project that will likely undergo significant refactors before it's completed. Also ongoing are my attempts at documenting its design here. Improvements and suggestions are highly welcome.

My goal is that after reading this document, you will understand Fiber well enough to follow along as it's implemented, and eventually even be able to contribute back to React.

Prerequisites
I strongly suggest that you are familiar with the following resources before continuing:


What is reconciliation?
reconciliation
The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.
update
A change in the data used to render a React app. Usually the result of `setState`. Eventually results in a re-render.
The central idea of React's API is to think of updates as if they cause the entire app to re-render. This allows the developer to reason declaratively, rather than worry about how to efficiently transition the app from any particular state to another (A to B, B to C, C to A, and so on).

Actually re-rendering the entire app on each change only works for the most trivial apps; in a real-world app, it's prohibitively costly in terms of performance. React has optimizations which create the appearance of whole app re-rendering while maintaining great performance. The bulk of these optimizations are part of a process called reconciliation.

Reconciliation is the algorithm behind what is popularly understood as the "virtual DOM." A high-level description goes something like this: when you render a React application, a tree of nodes that describes the app is generated and saved in memory. This tree is then flushed to the rendering environment — for example, in the case of a browser application, it's translated to a set of DOM operations. When the app is updated (usually via setState), a new tree is generated. The new tree is diffed with the previous tree to compute which operations are needed to update the rendered app.

Although Fiber is a ground-up rewrite of the reconciler, the high-level algorithm described in the React docs will be largely the same. The key points are:



This is a common theme in React design. Some popular libraries implement the "push" approach where computations are performed when the new data is available. React, however, sticks to the "pull" approach where computations can be delayed until necessary.


What is a fiber?
We're about to discuss the heart of React Fiber's architecture. Fibers are a much lower-level abstraction than application developers typically think about. If you find yourself frustrated in your attempts to understand it, don't feel discouraged. Keep trying and it will eventually make sense. (When you do finally get it, please suggest how to improve this section.)

Here we go!

We've established that a primary goal of Fiber is to enable React to take advantage of scheduling. Specifically, we need to be able to

pause work and come back to it later.
assign priority to different types of work.
reuse previously completed work.
abort work if it's no longer needed.
In order to do any of this, we first need a way to break work down into units. In one sense, that's what a fiber is. A fiber represents a unit of work.

To go further, let's go back to the conception of React components as functions of data, commonly expressed as

v = f(d)
It follows that rendering a React app is akin to calling a function whose body contains calls to other functions, and so on. This analogy is useful when thinking about fibers.

The way computers typically track a program's execution is using the call stack. When a function is executed, a new stack frame is added to the stack. That stack frame represents the work that is performed by that function.

When dealing with UIs, the problem is that if too much work is executed all at once, it can cause animations to drop frames and look choppy. What's more, some of that work may be unnecessary if it's superseded by a more recent update. This is where the comparison between UI components and function breaks down, because components have more specific concerns than functions in general.

Newer browsers (and React Native) implement APIs that help address this exact problem: requestIdleCallback schedules a low priority function to be called during an idle period, and requestAnimationFrame schedules a high priority function to be called on the next animation frame. The problem is that, in order to use those APIs, you need a way to break rendering work into incremental units. If you rely only on the call stack, it will keep doing work until the stack is empty.

Wouldn't it be great if we could customize the behavior of the call stack to optimize for rendering UIs? Wouldn't it be great if we could interrupt the call stack at will and manipulate stack frames manually?

That's the purpose of React Fiber. Fiber is reimplementation of the stack, specialized for React components. You can think of a single fiber as a virtual stack frame.

The advantage of reimplementing the stack is that you can keep stack frames in memory and execute them however (and whenever) you want. This is crucial for accomplishing the goals we have for scheduling.

Aside from scheduling, manually dealing with stack frames unlocks the potential for features such as concurrency and error boundaries. We will cover these topics in future sections.
